This project is a simplified implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using Java and  Swing for the graphical user interface. The game features Pac-Man moving through a maze,  collecting pellets, and avoiding ghosts. The player controls Pac-Man using arrow keys, and  the objective is to collect all pellets without being caught by the ghosts. 
 Features 
- Maze Layout: A predefined 2D array represents the game board, where:  - 1 represents walls (blue blocks). 
 - 2 represents pellets (magenta dots). 
 - 0 represents empty space. 
- Pac-Man Movement: Controlled using arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). - Ghosts: 
 - Two ghosts (red and green) move randomly within the maze. 
 - Collision with a ghost results in a game over. 
- Scoring System: 
 - Each pellet collected increases the score by 10 points. 
 - The score is saved to a file (score.txt). 
- Win Condition: The game is won when all pellets are collected. 
- Game States: 
 - Game Over: Triggered when Pac-Man collides with a ghost. 
 - Game Won: Triggered when all pellets are collected.
